# fccURLShortener
<h4>Shorten urls and get redirected on request</h4>

<p>User Story: I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.</p>

<p>User Story: If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid http://www.example.com format, the JSON response will contain an error instead.</p>

<p>User Story: When I visit that shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.</p>
